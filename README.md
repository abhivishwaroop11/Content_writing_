Solution:
1. The item I bought is damaged. How can I return it?
The products sold by Fit Unicorn come with a warranty. If you receive a damaged product, please try to contact our customer support team. You can return the damaged product. Just email your queries to support@fitunicorn.com. Our support team will assist you as soon as possible.

2. How long do I have to return an item I purchased and get a refund?
You have 30 days from the time of purchase, to return the product you bought from the Fit Unicorn app. You will get a refund for your product once you return it. If you fail to return the product within 30 days, then the return is not acceptable and you will not get a refund.

3. I returned an item 2 weeks ago. Why have I not received a refund yet?
Refunds for the products you return will be issued only when the returned products or items have been safely received by the Fit Unicorn warehouse with no damage and are brand new in their original packaging condition.
